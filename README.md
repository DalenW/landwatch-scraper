# LandWatch Scraper

This website scrapes LandWatch URLs for data. This was mostly done to get the price-per-acre data. 

It uses PostgresQL and Ruby 2.7.5. If you have both of those installed feel free to use this and run it yourself. The table is rendered with DataTables. You can set a page scrape limit in the LandSpider class which is located in app/models.
